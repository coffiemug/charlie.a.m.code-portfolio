greentiles abstract
https://editor.p5js.org/coffiemug/full/iw6wo5o60
created a pattern and tiled it across the canvas, using for() loops in both. the individual flowers were also made using for() loops.

greentiles new color ver.
https://editor.p5js.org/coffiemug/full/BPwrfcGGK
gave each flower a unique color this time and edited the pattern slightly.

gardenpatch generator
https://editor.p5js.org/coffiemug/full/mugb7g4Ao
based on greentiles color ver. but color, size, and placement are all randomized. I enjoy removing the noLoop() command and watching the flowers dance around :)

frogger game
https://editor.p5js.org/coffiemug/sketches/Bi5Ebyale
the goal was to get as close as possible tto making our own frogger or frogger-like game, something somewhat slightly above the level that our class had been taught to thus far. my game doesn't have any collision detection yet, but once you click on the canvas you ocan move the frog using the arrow keys, and there is a win message displayed when you hit the end!

butterfly bubble garden sim
https://editor.p5js.org/coffiemug/sketches/dioDEd7cQ
simulation where bubbles are blown from off screen (they multiply when they hit the left and right canvas edges) and are popped by flapping butterflies when they collide. tulip field in the background jitters in the breeze :)
